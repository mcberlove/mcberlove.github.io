        <p>Dear Reader,
Welcome to my page! My name is Michal Berlove and I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, double majoring in English and Economics. Upon graduating, I plan to move to Israel and am seeking professional writing jobs.
</p>
<p>My portfolio contains writing samples ranging from grants that I have written and collaborated on to press releases and blog posts that I wrote for my recent internship at UMass Press, UMass’s academic publisher. 
</p>
<p>In addition to my professional writing experience, I have experience in development and fundraising. I am currently working as a development intern for the Mother’s Milk Bank Northeast, a nonprofit in my hometown that provides vulnerable babies with mothers' breastmilk.</p>
<p>Academically, I am focused on my thesis for the Commonwealth Honors College, exploring the field of decision-making in daily life and how humans experience risk in the real world. </p>
<p>Outside of school and work, I am involved in UMass Hillel, the center of Jewish life on campus. I serve as the president of the Modern Orthodox club, Degel. Our club is open to students of all backgrounds and offers weekly social opportunities, learning opportunities, and a meaningful Shabbat experience. This community has become my home while at college and I am deeply grateful for the friendships that I have made throughout my time here.
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio and learn more about me! <br><br> All the best, <br> Michal
</p>
